# sccoos-sass-calibration

Applies calibration coefficients to the output of SCCOOS automated shore side instruments and writes out new files.

sccoos-sass-calibration is a tool written in Python that will to convert raw voltages from SCCOOS's automated shore 
stations into oxygen, pH, and chlorophyll.

The raw data are posted online by Scripps. The equations for the calibrations are provided by the manufacturers of the
sensors. The calibration coefficients are posted by SCCOOS in a Google Sheet. After calibration, the data will be
posted [at a location hosted by Axiom TBD] for ingestion into the Axiom's sensor system and posting on ERDDAP.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* Conda environment [TBD]
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required
* You have installed the latest version of `<coding_language/dependency/requirement_1>`

## Installing SASS

Installation
------------

This project relies on conda for installation and managing of the project dependencies.

1. [Download and install miniconda for your operating system](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. Clone this project with `git`.

3.  Once conda is available build the environment for this project with:

    ```sh
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

    The above command creates a new conda environment titled `sass_calibration` with the necessary project
    dependencies.

4. An Additional environment file is present for testing and development environments. The additional developer dependencies can be installed with
:

   ```sh
   conda env update -f test-environment.yml
   ```

## Using SASS

To use SASS, follow these steps:

```
python ./run_sass.py --start "2021-08-01T00:00:00" --end "2021-08-02T00:00:00" --station "sio"
```
Arguments include:
* start date (required)
* end date (required)
* station code (optional - does all if not specified)
