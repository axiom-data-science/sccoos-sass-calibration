# sccoos-sass-calibration

sccoos-sass-calibration is a tool written in Python that will to convert raw voltages from SCCOOS's automated shore 
stations into oxygen, pH, and chlorophyll.

The raw data are posted online by Scripps. The equations for the calibrations are provided by the manufacturers of the
sensors. The calibration coefficients are posted by SCCOOS in a Google Sheet. After calibration, the data will be
posted [at a location hosted by Axiom TBD] for ingestion into the Axiom's sensor system and posting on ERDDAP.
