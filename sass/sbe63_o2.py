"""Define the equations that calibrate O2.

Oxygen in the SASS system is measured using a Sea-Bird Scientific SBE 63
Optical Dissolved Oxygen Sensor. The output from  the instrument consists of
2 variables: units of phase (µsec) and temperature voltage (V). First instrument
temperature is calculated, and then that is used to calculate oxygen in units
of ml/l.

The temperature sensor is different from the CTD's, and it is calibrated separately.
The equations for the temperature calibration came from an example of the calibration
sheet provided by SBE. These values are entered in the SASS Inventory and Cleaning google
spreadsheet under the tab "SBE 63 O2".

The equations for the oxygen calculation come from the SBE63 manual (PDF included in
references). It is broken into pieces for the pressure correction, the salinity correction,
the Stern-Volmer constant, and the penultimate calculation.
