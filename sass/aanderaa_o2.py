""" Define the equations that calibrate O2 from Aanderaa Optode.

The self calibrating SeapHOx installed at the Scripps Pier in 2022 includes an
Aanderaa instrument for measuring Oxygen. The model number is 5730.
The instrument reports "O2con", "O2sat", and "O2temp", meaning that the raw
voltages have already been converted.

However, these values still need to be corrected for salinity and pressure. I have
two references for this calculation.
* https://www.aanderaa.com/media/pdfs/oxygen-optode-4330-4835-and-4831.pdf pages 19 and 17
* https://github.com/taylorwirth4/ScrippsPierSCS_SASS/blob/main/correct_DO_with_sal.py
(Taylor is the instrument operator)

The corrections are only done to O2con, and the units are uM (also different
from the SBE63.

Also, unlike the SBE63, the coefficients do not appear to change, and so
can be hardcoded.
