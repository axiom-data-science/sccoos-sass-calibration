"""Define the equations that calibrate pH.

pH in the SASS system is measured with a SBE SeaFET instrument.
There are 2 sensors on a SeaFET - an internal sensor enclosed in gel, that is more
accurate in general, and an external sensor that can be more accurate when corrected
with salinity. Voltages and initial values are included for both these in the raw
data files. The external pH was produced using an average salinity for the
area.

The possibility of re-computing internal pH is included it for testing purposes.
The meat of the routine is correcting the external pH.

From the technical note, Technical_Note_Calculating_pH_AppNote.pdf
(Application Note 99 from SBE):
"This application note provides formulas to calculate pHTotal from raw ISFET
voltage (VFET/REF ) and CTD data. Formulas for calculating pH Internal and pH External
from a Shallow SeaFET/SeapHOx V ... are listed below. "
